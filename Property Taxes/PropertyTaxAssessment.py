'''
A city collects property taxes based on the assessment value of a property. The 
assessment value is 60% of the propertyâ€™s actual value. If a property is valued at
$100,000.00, the assessment value is $60,000.00. The property tax is calculates as
$0.75 for each $100 of assessment value. The tax for a property assessed at $60,000.00
would therefore be $450.00 This GUI program requests the user to enter the actual 
property value and then the program displays the assessed value and the property tax.
